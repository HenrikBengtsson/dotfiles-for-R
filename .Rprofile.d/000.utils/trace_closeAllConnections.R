#' Calling [base::closeAllConnections()] is a very harsh action.  It closes
#' all open R connections regardless who created them.  It should never be
#' called in an R package.  There's also little reason for calling it from
#' an R script, or even from the R prompt.  If you find yourself having to
#' do so, your R session is probably already in such a bad shape that it's
#' better to restart R all along.
#'
#' This tracer detects whenever `closeAllConnections()` is called.
#' It can then produce an informative warning or and error.  If an error,
#' then no connections will be closed.
