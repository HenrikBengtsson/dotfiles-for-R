# dotfiles-for-R

This repository provides examples on what my (@HenrikBengtsson) `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron` files look like.

My R dotfiles are actually located in individual files in directories `.Rprofile.d/` and `.Renviron.d/`, respectively.  For this to work, you need to keep `.Rprofile` as is, because it is responsible for importing the content of those to directories.
