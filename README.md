# dotfiles-for-R

This repository provides examples on what my (@HenrikBengtsson) `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron` files look like.
To allow for easy tweaking across platforms and systems, my `.Rprofile` file is setup to be complete generic
and load all `.Rprofile.<something>` files it can locate.  Thus, the idea is to never edit `.Rprofile`,
but instead one of the other files.
